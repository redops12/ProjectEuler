// turns out that this is as simple as finding integer solutions to the equation
// x^2 - 2xy - y^2 - x + y = 0
// Wolfram alpha can solve these and gives a closed form for solutions
// y = \frac{\left(\left(3+2\sqrt{2}\right)^{n}-\left(3-2\sqrt{2}\right)^{n}\right)}{(4\sqrt{2})}
// use n = 16 which is big enough and then solve for x to get
// x = 756872327473
